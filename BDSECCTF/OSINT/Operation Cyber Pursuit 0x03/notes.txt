On his mastodon account, the hacker posted a picture, probably from the location he was in.
See file in the folder.

Using google lens, the picture represents the Bashundhara shopping mall in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
On the bottom of the picture, there is "realme Shot on GT Master"

A google search of Hax0r BD returns a github repository: https://github.com/htr-tech/haxorbd
Which seems to be related to Bangladesh
But I'm note sure it is related to the challenge.

He's got an instagram account:
https://www.instagram.com/hax0r_bd/
where he posted several photos. Let's geoint them on google lens

On the bus on one ofthe pictures (https://www.instagram.com/p/Cuhvk0mhtbe/), it's written "New York City Bus"

flag:
