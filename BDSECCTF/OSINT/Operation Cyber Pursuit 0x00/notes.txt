Our goal is to find the hacker's account name.
Some social networks use handles, like instagram or twitter
a quick search on twitter finds us an account: hax0r_bd account created this year (probably CTF-related), not too many following / followers.

twitter.com/hax0r_bd

flag:
BDSEC{hax0r_bd}
