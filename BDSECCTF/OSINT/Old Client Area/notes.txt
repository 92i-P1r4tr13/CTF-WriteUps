Goal is to find the old client area

a simple google dorks helps us find an old registered subdomain:
site:nstechvalley.com

two main subdomains appear:
my.nstechvalley.com
clients.nstechvalley.com

clicking on either redirects us to the new one:
my.nstechvalley.com

flag:
BDSEC{clients.nstechvalley.com}
