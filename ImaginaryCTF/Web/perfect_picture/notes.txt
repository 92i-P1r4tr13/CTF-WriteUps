We have an app which asks for an image upload.

I tried it with our team's logo, but that wasn't "good enough".

Let's look at the code: we have the python files, some templates and a Docker file.
In the Dockerfile, we know the flag is in ./flag.txt.
In the python file, we understand quickly what this is about: we need to create the perfect picture.
Let's try to solve it using PIL (./solver.py) and exiftool

Flag:
ictf{7ruly_th3_n3x7_p1c4ss0_753433}
