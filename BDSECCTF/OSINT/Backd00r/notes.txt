google: "NomanProdhan php backdoor"

1st result is a github

https://github.com/NomanProdhan/devil-php-backdoor

there is php code, which is obfuscated. When trying to deobfuscate it, nothing seems to be that interesting.

I went to the commit history page.
One commit (2119524), which was the first commit had uploaded a different PHP file.

When deobfuscating this one, a cool variable appeared: $_POST["pass"] == "BDSEC{_d3V1L_PHP_b4CKD00r_}")

Flag:
BDSEC{_d3V1L_PHP_b4CKD00r_}
