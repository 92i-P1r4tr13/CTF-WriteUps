I tried to look at the requests, and the only thing I found was an SQL injection.
Errors were sent from the server to the attacker after weird characters were input
"'{[(--...>
these errors came from mysql
The attack (I think) was a time-base SQLI

I think there was some broken access control as well.

There were some XSS attemps but these didn't work.
