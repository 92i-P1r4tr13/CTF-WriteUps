 Old Client Area
25 Points

Our sponsor NS TechValley recently changed their billing system and they moved the billing/client area to a new domain/sub-domain. Can you find the old billing area domain/sub-domain?

If the old billing/client area domain/sub-domain is https://login.nstechvalley.com then the flag will be BDSEC{login.nstechvalley.com}
