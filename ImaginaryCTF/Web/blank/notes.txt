It's a webapp with a login form, but nothing seems to be interesting at first glance.
We have the source code, as usual Dockerfile and source files

the flag is at ./flag.txt

in the source code, there are SQL statements which do not seem to be escaped.
I believe there is an SQL injection

I have a feeling thet the content not being sent as a JSON body is a problem...
