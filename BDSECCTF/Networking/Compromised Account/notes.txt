First steps: see IP Addr

We have to find a request that went through and displayed credentials.
By the looks of the HTTP requests (and the presence of the SLEEP SQL command), this looks like a time-based SQL injection.

The way to solve the challenge would be to open the file with https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark and make a script to find all malicious HTTP calls and their response,
analyzing the code and interpreting in.

At the end, the attacker added an account:
username=someone&email=someone%40someone.com&country=Germany&password=someone&submit_btn=SIGN+UP

Okay That was not that.

I found a request near the end to url "/app/admin_panel/process_login.php"
The request body looks like this:
email=root%40nanomate-solutions.com&password=41528ac7f116e9661cf57be7cd79e1a2&submit_btn=SIGN+IN
So I just had to URL decode it:
email=root@nanomate-solutions.com&password=41528ac7f116e9661cf57be7cd79e1a2&submit_btn=SIGN+IN

Flag:
BDSEC{root_41528ac7f116e9661cf57be7cd79e1a2}


The attacker seems to register a user at the end:
email=someone@someone.com
password=someone
 -- not useful
================

Well, that wasn't it...
Looking again throught the packets, I'm looking for login attemps and their response (wireshark filter: http contains "POST /app/includes/process_login" or http contains "HTTP/1.1 302 Found")

Now I'm looking for the first request that went through:
email=tareq@gmail%2ecom&password=tareq@nanomate&submit_btn=SIGN+IN
URL decoded:
email=tareq@gmail.com&password=tareq@nanomate&submit_btn=SIGN+IN

So flag should be:
BDSEC{tareq_tareq@nanomate}
