Using his twitter account: twitter.com/hax0r_bd

his first tweet is:
wow WordPress CVE-2023-2745 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

But it is a fake flag.

pursuing the investigation, I try to whatsmyname.app his handle, it returns me with 3 websites:
https://mastodon.social/@hax0r_bd
https://pastebin.com/u/hax0r_bd
and obviously his twitter

on his pastebin, only one paste (https://pastebin.com/b4XVaF9j), looks like a "dumped data"base: names, height, weight...
comment at the top of the file is
Gov sites sucks CVE-2023-23752 rocks ðŸ˜‹

Note: the challenge was solvable through mastodon as well.

flag:
BDSEC{CVE-2023-23752}
