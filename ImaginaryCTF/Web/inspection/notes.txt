I tried entering
ictf
ictf{ictf}

and got bamboozled

the channel being called inspection, I inspected the element.
The node looks like this:
                                <b>Description</b>
                                <p m4rkdown_parser_fail_1a211b44="">Here's a freebie: the flag is ictf.</p>

                                <b>Attachments</b>
                                <p>N/A</p>

There's a weird attribute: m4rkdown_parser_fail_1a211b44=""

flag:
ictf{m4rkdown_parser_fail_1a211b44}
